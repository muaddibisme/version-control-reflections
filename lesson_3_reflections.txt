When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Whenever you need to collaborate between more than one PC or with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-Remote changes might interfere with local changes. Thus manual pull is better.
